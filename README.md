# Java Sample Apps

This repository contains a collection of Java applications, organized into two categories: **Simple Apps** and **Intermediate Apps**. Each app demonstrates specific Java concepts, and they are designed to help you practice and explore Java development.

## Simple Apps

### 1. **HelloWorldApp - Basic Syntax**
A simple "Hello World" program to demonstrate the structure of a Java application and how to print output to the console.

- **Concepts**: Basic syntax, `main` method, `System.out.println()`
- **Example**: Print "Hello, World!" to the console.

### 2. **CalculatorApp - Basic Arithmetic Operations**
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Concepts**: Arithmetic operations, conditionals, `Scanner` class
- **Example**: Takes two numbers and an operator as input, then outputs the result.

### 3. **FileIOApp - File Input/Output**
Demonstrates reading from and writing to files using Javaâ€™s `FileReader` and `BufferedWriter` classes. This app showcases basic file handling and exception management.

- **Concepts**: File I/O, try-with-resources, `IOException`
- **Example**: Read data from a file and write processed data to another file.

## Intermediate Apps

### 1. **ConcurrencyApp - Multithreading and Synchronization**
A program that demonstrates how to manage multiple threads running simultaneously, including the use of synchronization for thread safety.

- **Concepts**: Threads, `Runnable`, `synchronized` blocks, thread safety
- **Example**: Multiple threads updating a shared counter with synchronized access.

### 2. **BankingApp - Object-Oriented Programming**
A simple banking system where users can manage accounts, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking.

- **Concepts**: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- **Example**: Simulates multiple bank accounts with methods to manage transactions.

### 3. **ChatApp - Client-Server Networking**
A basic client-server chat application where multiple clients can send and receive messages through a central server.

- **Concepts**: Networking with `Socket` and `ServerSocket`, multithreading for handling multiple clients
- **Example**: A chat server accepting connections from multiple clients.
